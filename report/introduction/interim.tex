It’s a good idea to *try* to write the introduction to your final report early on in the project. However, you will find it hard, as you won’t yet have a complete story and you won’t know what your main contributions are going to be. However, the exercise is useful as it will tell you what you *don’t* yet know and thus what questions your project should aim to answer. For the interim report this section should be a short, succinct, summary of the project’s main objectives. Some of this material may be re-usable in your final report, but the chances are that your final introduction will be quite different.  You are therefore advised to keep this part of the interim report short, focusing on the following questions: What is the problem, why is it interesting and what’s your main idea for solving it?  (DON'T use those three questions as subheadings however!  The answers should emerge from what you write.)
